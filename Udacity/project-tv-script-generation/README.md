# TV Script Generation

## Introduction

In this project, I generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. I use a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network I build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

## Getting the project files
The project files can be found in my [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/yao23/DeepLearning_Playground/tree/master/Udacity/project-tv-script-generation), in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using

``
git clone https://github.com/yao23/DeepLearning_Playground.git
``
