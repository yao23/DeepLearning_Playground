# SageMaker Deployment Project

## Project description
In this project, I construct a recurrent neural network to determine the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service and deploy the model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

### Sample Negative Response
'The movie Big Fish is not cool since it's so complicated and hard to understand.'

### Sample Positive Response
'The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.'

### Sample Positive Response
'I really like this movie, it's the best action movie I have seen. Matt Damon played a significant action role in the movie history!'
