# Face Generation

## Introduction
In this project, I use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces. The model is trained using celebrity images for 60 epochs to generate some realistic face images by its own. You can see from the images below that as you train the model for more epochs, it generates realistic images with more authentic features.

### Images generated after epoch: 5

### Images generated after epoch: 10
